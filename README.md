# QR Scan

The goal of QR Scan is to create the best QR & barcode scanner that is completely free to use and doesn't have any ads. Because I am unable to add every possible feature myself, I invite you to participate in development by forking and opening pull requests with new features.

## Features

The app is currently in a very early alpha stage, and support for many features will still be lacking. However, a lot of work has already been done and the app is stable enough for daily use.
